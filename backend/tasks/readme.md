## Notes
1. **Task Model:** The Task model includes a title, due_time, and a completed status.
2. **Admin Interface:** The TaskAdmin class customizes the admin panel display.
3. **Serialization:** The TaskSerializer converts model instances to JSON and vice versa.
4. **Flutter Integration:** You will use this API in your Flutter app to handle CRUD operations and notifications for tasks.

To complete the app, you'll need to set up views, URLs, and possibly notifications in your Flutter app for real-time task alerts. Let me know if you need help with those parts!
