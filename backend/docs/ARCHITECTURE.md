### `ARCHITECTURE.md`
This document outlines the architecture of the application.

# Architecture

## Overview
The application is built using Django for the backend and Flutter for the frontend. It serves as a task management system, allowing users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks.

## Components

### 1. Models
- **Task**: Represents a task with attributes like `title`, `due_time`, and `completed`.

### 2. Views
- **TaskListCreateView**: Handles listing and creating tasks.
- **TaskDetailView**: Handles retrieving, updating, and deleting tasks.

### 3. Serializers
- **TaskSerializer**: Converts Task model instances to JSON format and vice versa.

### 4. URLs
- Routes are defined for listing/creating tasks and for task detail operations.

### 5. Admin
- Task model is registered in the Django admin interface for easy management.

## Data Flow
1. **Client Requests**: Users interact with the Flutter app to manage tasks.
2. **API Endpoints**: The app communicates with the Django backend through defined API endpoints.
3. **Database**: Tasks are stored and managed in the Django database.

## Future Improvements
- Implement real-time notifications.
- Add user authentication.
- Enhance task management features.
