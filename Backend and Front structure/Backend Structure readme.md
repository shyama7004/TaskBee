4. `backend/docs/`:

## Setting Up

When you clone or initialize your Django project (backend directory), you should create these folders and files directly under the backend directory. This structure helps in organizing your Django project with clear separation of concerns:

  - Application Logic: `tasks/` contains models, serializers, views, and tests related to task management.
  - Documentation: `docs/` holds detailed documentation files.
  - Project Configuration: `backend/` contains Django project settings, manage script, and requirements.
